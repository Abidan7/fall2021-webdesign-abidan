    </pre>
<p>About the Author <br>
    Chris Coremans is software engineer specializing in front-end development. <br>
    An expert in HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery and Flash development with ActionScript. <br>
    I like his professional background! <br>
</p>
<p>About the Book <br>
    The author is confident that, in his book, any person who is interested in learning <br>
    HTML can do so without resorting to a "1000 page book". Mr. Coremans emphazises <br>
    that the reader will learn the basics techniques to style any plain document <br>
    and turn it to good looking web page fairly quickly.    
</p>
<p>My Personal Opinion <br>
    I personally like how the book is presented, the examples are clear and easy to follow. <br>
    The book has good examples that I was able to follow. <br>
    This book is perfect to supplement and practice what we are learning in this cohort <br>
    and would definetely recommend it. <br>

    <pre>Second Topic:
    CSS: The Missing Manual
    By: David Sawyer McFarland
    Publisher: Pogue Press, 2009  
    </pre>    
<p>About the Book <br>
    This book describes what CSS is, a Cascade style Sheets that gives the user creative control <br>
    over the layout and design of his/her web page. The purpose of this book is to give the reader <br>
    a better undertanding how CSS enchances HTML formatting with streamlined tags that HTML may have <br>
    limits over specific web browsers. <br>
    The book quickly points out the need of having basic knowledge of HTML before CSS can be introduced. <br>
</p>
<p>My Personal Opinion <br>
   This book contents are more like an informational directory rather than a book with tools and examples. <br>
   It lacks of engaging materials for the reader to start learning. Also, it seems a somewhat outdated. <br>
