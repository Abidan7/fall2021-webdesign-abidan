Project Personal Business Website

Planning and Design:
Based on the main idea of creating and maintaining my very own website, I have gathered what I believe it may include so visitors can have a pleasant viewing experience. My first website may be easy to access, navigation, and simple but with meaningful content.

For Fonts, I have chosen four (4) main fonts that may make my site amicable to the visitor:
Open Sans Condensed,
Lato, sans-serif,
Explora, cursive, and,
IBM Plex, sans-serif.

Of FontAwesome, I am inspired to use CC Stripe and Eraser. However, I am planning to use my very own design which dates back to 2002.

From Canva Wheel, there are three (3) color choices for background, contrast and transition. The chosen ones are #ac5365, #53aca2, #b14e5e. There are four more that I wish to chose from the same category.
