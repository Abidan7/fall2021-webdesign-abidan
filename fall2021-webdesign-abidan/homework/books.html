        <pre>First Topic:
        HTML: A Beginner’s Tutorial
        By:  Chris Coremans
        Book:  116 pages
        Publisher:  Brainy Software Corp. © 2015

        <p>About the Author <br>
        Chris Coremans is software engineer specializing in front-end development. <br>
        An expert in HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery and Flash development with ActionScript. <br>
        I like his professional background! <br>
        </p>
        <p>About the Book <br>
        The author is confident that, in his book, any person who is interested in learning <br>
        HTML can do so without resorting to a "1000 page book". Mr. Coremans emphazises <br>
        that the reader will learn the basics techniques to style any plain document <br>
        and turn it to good looking web page fairly quickly.    
        </p>
        <p>My Personal Opinion <br>
        I personally like how the book is presented, the examples are clear and easy to follow. <br>
        The book has good examples that I was able to follow. <br>
        This book is perfect to supplement and practice what we are learning in this cohort <br>
        and would definetely recommend it. <br>
        </p>   
    
        <pre>Second Topic:
        CSS: The Missing Manual
        By: David Sawyer McFarland
        Publisher: Pogue Press, 2009  
        </pre>    
        <p>About the Book <br>
        This book describes what CSS is, a Cascade style Sheets that gives the user creative control <br>
        over the layout and design of his/her web page. The purpose of this book is to give the reader <br>
        a better undertanding how CSS enchances HTML formatting with streamlined tags that HTML may have <br>
        limits over specific web browsers. <br>
        The book quickly points out the need of having basic knowledge of HTML before CSS can be introduced. <br>
        </p>
        <p>My Personal Opinion <br>
        This book contents are more like an informational directory rather than a book with tools and examples. <br>
        It lacks of engaging materials for the reader to start learning. Also, it seems a somewhat outdated. <br>
