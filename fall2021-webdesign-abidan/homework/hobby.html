                <h3>Dear Observer,</h3>
                <p>Hi! My name is Jose Abidan Ramirez and I am an amateur skywatcher. <br>
                This page is dedicated to those of you who look up to the sky, are curious about what's up there near and in the deep space.</p> 

                <p>Why do I enjoy doing this hobby? There is always something to look up at, I alsways feel fascinated to when I see the sky. Look up to hunt for planets, comets, meteor showers see the moon up close. Since I was a little kid, I would see that never ending, giant black screen that never stops moving until daybreak.</p>

                <p>If you are like me who wish to learn how to become an amateur skywatcher and don't know where to begin.</p>
                <p>You can start by doing the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First get outdoors, check the weather and see if there are any clouds that it may obstruct the view.</li>
                    <li>If you live in a city or town, you may have to travel to a rural less light polluted area to see the sky more clearly.</li>
                    <li>Downlowad sky maps in your smartphone or other capable portable device. Most popular ones are Sky Map, Sky Chart, NASA, among others, see further bellow.</li>
                </ul>    
                
                <p> Everyone can enjoy the space phenomena! Individuals with limited visual or with impairment are also part of the skywatching community. They do so by converting light to sonic waves, in other words, they listen to the radio waves from the heavens either from an app from a smartphone or listening to radio frequencies. Some do require digital instruments to catch specific frequencies like sound strikes from a meteor.</p>
                <p>Still, an instrument like a telescope or a smartphone is not mandatory to see a full moon, spot a planet or search for a constellation. Just a cloud free night sky will do the trick.</p>
                 
                <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>If you want to start investing in your next hobbie, you may need:</p>
                <ul>    
                    <li>A David H. Levi's Guide to the Stars Map, you can buy one for around $14.95. It comes with instructions and very easy to use. Hold it with your hands and search for specific stars. </li>
                    <li>One portable telescope for the urban dweller or a fixed one for the ones living outside of the big cities where is really dark.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p>Once you get comfortable, you can visit Space.com or NASA.gov to get updates of current or future events happening in the sky.</p>
                
                <h3>Where can I find more information?</h3>
                <p>Here are some helpful links to further get into your new passion:</p>
