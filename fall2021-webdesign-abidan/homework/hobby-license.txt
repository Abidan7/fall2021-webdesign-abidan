Welcome Navigator!

Hi! My name is Jose Abidan Ramirez, I am an amateur skywatcher.
This page is dedicated to all those of you who look up to the sky, are curious about what's up there near and in the deep space.

Why do I enjoy doing this hobby? There is always something up there to look at. I feel fascinated when I stare at the infinite sky.
I love to hunt for planets, comets, meteor showers see the moon up close. Since I was a little kid, I would see that never ending, giant black screen that never stops moving until daybreak.

If you are like me who wish to learn how to become an amateur skywatcher and don't know where to begin.
You can start by doing the following:

First get outdoors, check the weather and see if there are any clouds that it may obstruct the view.
If you live in a city or town, you may have to travel to a rural less light-polluted area to see the sky more clearly.
Downlowad sky maps in your smartphone or other capable portable device. Most popular ones are Sky Map, Sky Chart, NASA, among others, see further bellow.

Everyone can enjoy skywatching! Individuals with limited light reception or visual impairment are also part of the skywatching community.
They learn to do so by converting light to sonic waves, in other words, they listen to the radio waves from the heavens either from an app from a smartphone or listening description narratives from television, the internet or live dedicated speaking individuals. Aspiring astronomers learn about the cosmos through Braile, touch raised line drawings or other tactile graphics of images such as star charts and planetary maps. Some do require digital instruments to catch specific radio frequencies like sound strikes from a passing meteor.

Still, an instrument like a telescope or a smartphone is not mandatory to see a full moon, spot a planet or search for a constellation. Just a cloud free night sky will do the trick.

How much does this hobby cost?
If you want to start investing in your next hobbie, you may need:

Now you can hunt for other space bodies, enjoy!

One portable telescope or a pair of binoculars is helpful so that you can go chose a place where is really dark.
Make sure the lenses are clean with no haze and free of damage, a simple nick or scratch can ruin a nice observation.

Once you get settled, you can use a sky map visit Space.com or NASA.gov to get updates of current or future events happening in the sky.

Here is a collection of pictures taken by other stargazers including myself, enjoy!
